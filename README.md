# Trial Kanban App

The goal of this project is to create a lightweight, easy-to-use tool that can be integrated into small-scale workflows without the complexity of larger enterprise solutions.

This project is inspired by the excellent example found at [Refine CRM Minimal](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/examples/app-crm-minimal). A huge thanks to the Refine team for the inspiration and guidance.
